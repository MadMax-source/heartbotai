HeartBot AI - Filtering System (Phase 1) for Developer

Goal:

Build a system that listens to new Pump.fun token launches.

Apply user's custom filters (criteria they set).

If a token meets the filter, list it to the user with full token data.

NO auto-buy/sell yet — only monitor and alert.



---

1. User Filtering Options (via inline buttons)

User can set:

Market Cap (min, max)

Liquidity (min, max)

Time created (min, max in minutes)

Developer holding % (min, max)

Top holder % (min, max)

Bundle % (min, max)

Insiders % (min, max)

Total Holders (min, max)

5-min Volume (min, max)

Social media presence (at least 1 account) (❌/✅ toggle)



---

2. Behavior

Bot shows inline button menu for user to set these filters.

Save user's input (store in context.user_data).

After setting, when user clicks "➡️ Filter Now", bot starts monitoring tokens.



---

3. Monitoring & Matching

Listen to Pump.fun launches (via API or WebSocket).


Check if token meets the user's filtering criteria.

If yes, send user token data in a nice message:

Token Name

CA (Contract Address)

Market Cap

Liquidity

Dev holding

Top holder

Bundled %

Insiders %

Total holders

Time created

5M volume

Socials (Telegram, X links)



If not meeting filters, ignore.



---

4. Important:

No auto-buy, no transaction for now.

Only detect and send alerts.

Fast scanning speed is important.

Filters must work very accurately.



---

Example User Flow:

1. User /start bot.


2. User sets filter criteria using inline buttons.


3. User clicks "Filter Now".


4. Bot monitors live Pump.fun tokens.


5. If token matches criteria → Bot sends a detailed message to the user.

Future Upgrades (after phase 1):

Add auto-buy sniper function.

Add manual buy/sell function.

Add more sniper settings.

Important note:

> We first need a clean, working, fast filtering system.
Sniping will come later.
Focus now = filters + real-time detection + reporting.
