Great question. Let's break this down.

You're receiving **real-time token creation events** from the Pump.fun WebSocket, and you've proposed a robust set of filters. Now let's analyze **which fields are available directly** from the event data, and **which are not** (and would require external API calls or are not obtainable at all).

---

### ‚úÖ **Info You Can Extract Directly from Pump.fun WebSocket**

From this event:

```json
{
  "signature": "...",
  "mint": "...",
  "traderPublicKey": "...",
  "txType": "create",
  "initialBuy": 35411.372207,
  "solAmount": 0.000990099,
  "bondingCurveKey": "...",
  "vTokensInBondingCurve": 1072964588.627793,
  "vSolInBondingCurve": 30.000990098999978,
  "marketCapSol": 27.960838984787035,
  "name": "Solana‚Äôs Step Bro",
  "symbol": "Sexy sol",
  "uri": "...",
  "pool": "pump"
}
```

You can derive the following:

| Filter Option             | Status | Source / Calculation                                                          |
| ------------------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Market Cap (min, max)** | ‚úÖ      | `marketCapSol` (in SOL)                                                       |
| **Liquidity (min, max)**  | ‚úÖ      | `vSolInBondingCurve` is the current liquidity                                 |
| **Time created**          | ‚úÖ      | You can timestamp it yourself when receiving the event                        |
| **Developer holding %**   | ‚ùå      | Not available in this payload                                                 |
| **Top holder %**          | ‚ùå      | Requires reading token holders (external call to Solana explorer or RPC node) |
| **Bundle %**              | ‚ùå      | Not in event data; unclear what "bundle %" means without further context      |
| **Insiders %**            | ‚ùå      | Requires historical tracking or off-chain analysis                            |
| **Total Holders**         | ‚ùå      | Requires external API (Solscan, Helius, or Solana RPC node)                   |
| **5-min Volume**          | ‚ùå      | Not available; requires tracking volume over time                             |
| **Social media presence** | ‚ùå      | Requires fetching and parsing metadata from the `uri`                         |

### üü® **Fields That Can Be Derived Indirectly**

You **can** get the following info but will need **external API calls**:

| Filter Option             | How to Get It                                                                      |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Developer holding %**   | Query top holders via Solana RPC (getTokenLargestAccounts)                         |
| **Top holder %**          | Same as above                                                                      |
| **Total Holders**         | Solana RPC call: `getTokenSupply` or third-party APIs like Solscan or Helius       |
| **Social media presence** | Parse `uri` (likely points to a JSON metadata file that may include social links)  |
| **5-min Volume**          | You'd need to store buy/sell events over time and calculate rolling volume         |
| **Bundle % / Insiders %** | Requires definition‚Äîlikely involves analyzing wallets connected to project creator |

### ‚ùå **Unavailable or Vague Fields**

| Filter Option  | Why Unavailable                                                                |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Bundle %**   | Not standard; unclear metric unless defined by Pump.fun                        |
| **Insiders %** | No way to know which wallets are insiders unless predefined or manually tagged |
